myrror <- function(df1, df2, by, tolerance) {


  # Get arguments for later
  # args <- match.call()

  # Check Arguments (Function to be added later)
  # - df1 and df2 needs to be data.frames structures and not NAs -> if not, transform.
  # - by needs to be a character
  # - tolerance needs to be numeric

  # Column names and keys
  # - names need to be R accepted names.

  # Process data into two comparable datasets and adds to a myrror object
