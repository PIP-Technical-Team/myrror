# Objective: extract_diff_values() : depends on indexes identified in compare_values(),
# The function will go through each dataset associated with each variable stored
# in the output of compare_values() and select the the indexes when count > 0.
# Then it will return a list with a subset-dataset for each variable, with the
# observations identified by the selected indexes. These observations will be
# identified by the type of diff: value_to_na, na_to_value, change_in_value.
# The function will return:
# 1. A list with a 'subset-dataset for each variable', with the observations that
# are different in value (only that variable from dfx and dfy and the id).
# 2. Another pivoted "complete" data.table (all variables with id) with all observations
# for which variables are different: the user can then select the variables they want to keep.

extract_diff_value_int <- function(myrror_object = NULL) {

  compare_values_output <- compare_values_int(myrror_object = myrror_object)

  # Return
